A digital reproduction of the Battleship board game.

Since web development wasn't taught in my uni curriculum, I wanted to practice it on my own.

This project uses [jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing and [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to bundle the source code and build a minified webpage.

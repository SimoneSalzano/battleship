# battleship

A digital reproduction of the Battleship board game.

Since web development hasn't been taught in my university curriculum, I decided to learn and practice it on my own.

This project uses [jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing and [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to bundle the source code and build a minified webpage.
